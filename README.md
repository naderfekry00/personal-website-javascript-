## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.


### Links
- Live Site URL: https://naderfekry00.github.io/personal-website/

## My Process

### Built With

- **HTML** - For the markup and structure of the website.
- **CSS** - For styling the website.
- **Flexbox** - Used for creating flexible and responsive layouts.
- **CSS Grid** - Used for creating more complex layouts.
- **Sass** - For writing more efficient and maintainable CSS using variables, nesting, and mixins.

### What I Learned

In this project, I learned how to effectively use CSS Grid and Flexbox to create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. I also honed my skills in Sass to organize my stylesheets better, using variables and mixins to keep my code clean and manageable.
### Continued Development

In future projects, I want to continue improving my skills in responsive design and accessibility. I also want to dive deeper into advanced CSS techniques and explore more about JavaScript to add dynamic functionality to my websites.

### Useful Resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - A great resource for learning more about Flexbox, Grid, and advanced CSS techniques.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - An invaluable resource for web development documentation and tutorials.
